# Styling Status Summary

This document summarizes the styling-related tasks that have been completed and those that are pending in the project.

## Completed Styling Tasks

*   **`react-haiku` Integration:** The `useSwipeDetection` and `useLocalStorage` hooks from `react-haiku` have been successfully installed and integrated into the project. While these are primarily functional hooks, their integration impacts the overall user experience and flow on mobile, which is a key aspect of the mobile enhancements phase.
*   **`Spotlight` Component - Basic Structure & Integration:** A basic `Spotlight` component has been created (`src/components/Spotlight.tsx`) and integrated into `App.tsx`. It is currently set up to receive `highlightedCells` data and apply a basic background color as a placeholder.

## Pending Styling Tasks

## React Bits Installation & Integration

During the development process, we installed and integrated several components from the `react-bits` library to enhance the project's visual appeal and user experience, aligning with the "digital sanctuary" and "mystical" themes.

The installation process involved a few steps:

1.  **Initial `jsrepo` attempt and clarification:** We initially attempted to install specific components using `jsrepo install <component-name>` based on external documentation. However, this command was incorrect and required `jsrepo` to be initialized first.
2.  **Installing `jsrepo` globally:** We installed the `jsrepo` command-line tool globally to manage `react-bits` components:


*   **`Spotlight` Component - Styling Refinement:** The current styling for the `Spotlight` component is a basic background color. This needs to be refined to create a more sophisticated and visually appealing highlighting effect for the 3, 6, and 9 grid cells. This could involve using borders, glow effects, shadows, or animations to draw attention to these specific numbers in a "mystical" way.
*   **`Particles` Component - Implementation & Integration:** The `Particles` component has been created (`src/components/Particles.tsx`) with a placeholder. The full implementation of the particle effect logic and rendering is pending. This component needs to be integrated into the application's layout, likely as a background element, to provide ambient visual flair.

## Future Styling Considerations

Based on the project plan, the following styling-related features are potential future enhancements:

*   **`useKeyPress` for Easter Eggs:** This hook, also likely from `react-bits` or a similar source, could be used to trigger visual easter eggs or special effects when specific key combinations (potentially related to 3-6-9) are pressed. This would involve implementing the visual feedback for these easter eggs.
*   **`SplitText` for Title Animations:** A `SplitText` component could be used to create more dynamic and visually interesting animations for titles and headings within the application, further enhancing the mystical theme.

Addressing the pending tasks will significantly enhance the visual appeal and user experience, particularly for the "Tesla Mysticism" phase of the project.
